Midterm Project: Workout Timer App
Create a Workout Timer App

We want to create an app that lists a series of workouts. When users tap on a workout, the app will navigate to another screen that has a timer fragment inside it. The user can start the timer and it will count down to zero from the predetermined time that was passed to this screen.
